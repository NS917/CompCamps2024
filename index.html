            <p>
                ive implemented many features including a title screen, movement with animations and a turn based battle
                system
            </p>
            <p>
                In my game all of my assets were made by me excluding the fonts used.

                I've been playing guitar for 7 years and I've really enjoyed it. when I first started i didnt practice much but as I got older i realized i wouldn't improve unless i practiced more. i find this is true not only with guitar but with many things especially learning a new skill like coding.

            <p>
                Undertale is a indie rpg game made in Gamemaker, just like mine. It is a big inspiration for me as it was the first gamemaker game i ever played, and the fact that all the code and most of the assets were made by one person encouraged me to made my own game.
